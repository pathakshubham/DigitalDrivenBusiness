Notes:
My favorite movies that I chose for this assignment are Avatar, Sherlock Holmes and Pirates of the caribbean. 
I followed the steps which are nicely explained in the booklet, in order to complete the postgres part of the assignment for the movies mentioned above.
There were a lot of interesting results for all the movies I chose but for the final assignment, I decided to analyze Avatar.It had plenty of reviews in the Reviews file, so it was more interesting.
In the zip file, I have included a few photos from the work on the RPI and codes as a proof.
